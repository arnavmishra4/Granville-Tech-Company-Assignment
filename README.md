# README: Model Evaluation for Fine-Tuned Llama 3.1 8B

## Introduction
This repository contains the evaluation framework for a **Llama 3.1 8B model**, which has been fine-tuned using **Unsloth** on conversational data. The primary objective of this model is to improve natural language understanding and response generation in dialogue-based tasks. The evaluation pipeline ensures that the fine-tuned model is rigorously tested for performance, accuracy, and reliability.

## Model Fine-Tuning with Unsloth
**Unsloth** is a lightweight and efficient library optimized for training large language models with reduced memory and computational overhead. It was chosen for fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B due to:
- **Memory Efficiency:** Enables fine-tuning large models on consumer-grade GPUs.
- **Speed:** Faster optimization techniques, making it ideal for large-scale conversational datasets.
- **Compatibility:** Seamless integration with Hugging Face’s Transformers and PyTorch.

## Notebook Overview: `Model_Eval.ipynb`
This notebook contains multiple functions and classes for evaluating the model's performance. Below is a detailed breakdown of each component:

### 1. Loading the Fine-Tuned Model
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
```
- **Purpose:** Loads the fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B model along with its tokenizer.
- **Why Used?** This ensures consistency between training and inference by using the exact same pre-trained weights and tokenization.

### 2. Dataset Preparation
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
```
- **Purpose:** Loads test datasets for model evaluation.
- **Why Used?** Standardized datasets help in fair benchmarking and reproducibility.

### 3. Evaluation Metrics
```python
from evaluate import load
```
- **Purpose:** Computes NLP metrics like **BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity**.
- **Why Used?** Provides quantitative measures of model performance on conversational tasks.

### 4. Inference Pipeline
```python
def generate_response(model, tokenizer, prompt, max_length=100):
```
- **Purpose:** Generates model responses based on input prompts.
- **Why Used?** Enables qualitative assessment of the model’s conversational ability.

### 5. Benchmarking Against Other Models
```python
def compare_with_baseline(fine_tuned_model, baseline_model, dataset):
```
- **Purpose:** Compares the fine-tuned Llama model with a baseline (e.g., GPT-3, Alpaca).
- **Why Used?** Helps validate improvements made during fine-tuning.

### 6. Error Analysis & Visualization
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
- **Purpose:** Plots error distributions and model confidence levels.
- **Why Used?** Visual insights aid in diagnosing weaknesses and refining future models.

## Conclusion
This notebook provides a complete evaluation framework for assessing the performance of a fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B model trained with **Unsloth**. The inclusion of multiple metrics, benchmarking, and visualizations ensures a thorough understanding of the model’s capabilities.

## Future Improvements
- Experimenting with **LoRA** for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
- Extending evaluations with **human feedback**.
- Deploying the model via **FastAPI or Gradio** for real-world testing.
